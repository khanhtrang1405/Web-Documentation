			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Solar Citizens is an independent, non-profit organisation (NPO). Their mission is to bring Australia’s solar owners and supporters together to provide “a renewable future for all Australians”, where everyone can have access to affordable and clean energy. They aim <strong>to protect solar owners’ rights and campaign for “sensible clean energy policies” </strong> the coal industry that lobby against the country’s transition to renewable energy.

      <p> They're independent so they are <strong>not biased </strong>towards any political party, company or organisation. </p>

			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>This section aims to <em>research on key information and identify target audience</em> the proposed website using primary and secondary research</br></br>

      Primary research is conducted through questionnaires to <strong>identify the needs, requirements, motivations and frustrations </strong> users about charity work as well as Solar Citizens website. </br></br>

      Secondary research focuses on Solar Citizens’ work and solar energy. This will be done first to guide the content of primary research and the proposal as the demographics, activities and stakeholders would have been identified and evaluated. </p>

      <h4 id="second"> Secondary Research</h4>
      <h5 id="sc work"> Solar Citizens' works</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>As of today, Australia has more than 2 million solar photovoltaic (solar PV) installations across Australia. From the 2019-2020 annual report, the organization has grown their supporter base to more than 10,700 people. Also, 118,111 people have joined the community. In 2019, they received $652,805 (97,90% of total income) from donations, appeals and merchandise sales (Solar Citizens, 2019). </li></br>

        <li>Their activities include raising awareness about renewable energy through events, reports, materials and campaigns. People can get involved through donations or volunteering to help with the events or to share with families and friends about the NGO or benefits of solar energy. </li></br>
      </ul>

      <h5 id="user research"> User research</h5>
      <p> <strong>Identifying age groups</strong> <br>

      In order to identify the user groups for the proposed website,  Solar Citizen’s website and social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are being observed and investigated. To support the findings, a blog post about social media analytics (Chan, 2020) consists of demographics from different platforms. From the research, it can be seen that a wider range of audience, from young to old with middle-aged users are more common, is seen on Facebook.<br> <br>
       Meanwhile, Instagram and Twitter have a younger audience, mainly millennials. Moreover, from looking at the photos shared on these three sites, it is shown that Solar Citizens’ volunteers are diverse in age, ranging from teenagers to elders. Because of that, the following three audience groups are established:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Teenagers: 18-24 year olds </li>
        <li>Adults: 25-54 year olds</li>
        <li>Elders: 55+ year olds </li>
      </ol>

      <p> <strong>Solar users</strong></br>

      A study, commissioned by Solar Citizens, found that households with lower to middle income range account for the majority of solar purchasers in Australia (Hannam, 2010). Home ownership is another feature of solar users. Therefore, the most solar purchasers are in the higher range of the adults and elders as they want to control their electricity costs. In contrast, the younger age group has the lowest solar panels ownership (ABS, 20115-16) which relate to the positive correlation between home ownership rates and age.
      </p> 

      <h5 id="donations"> Donations</h5>
      <p> The ‘Australia Giving 2019’ report by Good2Give and Charity Aid Foundation (CAF) provides insights about Australians’ motivations, habits and preferences of their giving trends.</br></br>

      In 2019, donation rates are fairly similar across all age groups. However, younger donors aged 25-34 years old are the most likely to donate (74%) to support a range of causes from supporting children to human rights protection. (Good2Give and CAF, 2019). </br></br>

      In addition, when being asked about why they donate, for older donors aged 55 years and above, caring about the cause (64%) and trusting the organisations (43%) are the main drives. Meanwhile, many younger donors struggle from societal pressure to donate as society expects them to (15%) and because of their family (13%) (Good2Give and CAF, 2019). </br></br>

      Furthermore, 41% of respondents stated that knowing where and how their money would be spent would encourage them to donate more, followed by how transparent and well-regulated the sector is with 23%. (Good2Give and CAF, 2019)</br></br>

      Donation rates also vary in household incomes. Those with $100k or more of household income donate the most with 79%, followed by 72% of those with income ranging from $50k to $90k and 59% of those with $50k of family income(Good2Give and CAF, 2019). From these statistics, it can be assumed that although younger donors donate the most, the amount donated is less than other age groups because their income is way less. </br></br>
      </p>

      <h5 id="volunteer"> Volunteering</h5>
      <p>In 2019, a third (35%) of the population volunteered (Good2Give and CAF, 2019). This is a significant increase from 19% of the population in 2016 (.id, 2019). This data is published in the 2016 Census byThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), which reports about Australia’s growth in volunteering work. <br> <br>
      Like donation, younger Australians aged 18-24 years old are more likely to volunteer in 2019 (47%), compared to 28% of those who are 55 and above (Good2Give and CAF, 2019). The 45-54 age group has the highest rates of volunteering at 679,602 people, according to the 2016 Census (volunteering queensland, 2017). <br> <br>
      In contrast to traditional physical volunteering, younger people prefer “invisible” volunteering (i.e. Volunteering through online work) (Isa, 2018)<br> <br>

      <h4 id="primary"> Primary Research</h4>
      <p>The questionnaire aims to research users' contributing habits and their thoughts about giving. I received 10 responses and all are at the age range of 18-25 and are University students. <br><br>
      <h5 id="ques1"> Renewable energy and charity work </h5>
      
       Interestingly, although all participants are interested in renewable energy, only 20% own or know anyone that owns solar-powered products. Moreover, 6 respondents said that they would be interested to try solar-powered products, with the reasons are mainly for environmental purpose, including:
      <ul>
        <li>“To lessen my carbon footprint.”</li>
        <li>“Would be cool to have reusable / cleaner sources of energy in my own day to day life”</li>
      </ul>
    
      Next, the questions focus more about charity overall. All participants said that they have contributed to a charity before, mostly by donating (100%) and volunteering (80%).  I asked why do they donate and many responses were about societal pressure, these include: 
      <ul>
        <li> “ I donated because all my friends did it.”</li>
        <li>“The school forced me to donate.”</li>
      </ul>
      However, some (30%) did because they wanted to contribute to make a change and help the community. <br> <br>
      Furthermore, the vast majority of participants (90%) have never heard about charity that focuses on renewable energy like Solar Citizens. Interestingly, 90% of participants would be willing to support through digital (i.e. help through online activities) or traditional volunteering. This figure doubles the number of participants who would be willing to donate to renewable energy organizations. The reason for this preference as the respondents don’t have much money as they’re all university students. They are afraid of scams and tend to be skeptical about the transparency of the organization.  <br> <br>
       <h5 id="ques2"> Solar Citizens’ site </h5>
 
      Although 40% of participants enjoy the clear and intuitive layout of information, some (20%) find that it is too clustered and wordy. The site’s color scheme is also a topic of debate as the respondents are splitted between liking and hating it.  <br> <br>
      When asking about the changes they would make to the sites, many (60%) would want to have a page where Solar Citizens educate the users about solar energy. Since the site is still clustered and wordy, some (20%) suggested to include videos and reduce the writing part.  <br> <br>
      
      <h3 id="audience">Target Audience</h3>
      
      <blockquote>
				From researching, I decided to focus on the teenagers (18-24) and adults (25-35) groups.<br><br>
        With the teenagers group, although based on secondary research, they’re the most likely to donate and volunteer, it is found from the questionnaire that most of them don’t know about organizations like Solar Citizens. Therefore, targeting them can help to gain more participants to the charity, given that the main concept of my proposal is to encourage people to donate and volunteer. <br><br>
        The adults group is chosen as it can be seen from online observation that they’re the most active on social media as well as charity work. They would also have higher income compared to the teenagers group which can help bring bigger donations to the organization. <br><br>
        These groups would also be more tech-savvy than older demographics. As a result, this will give more freedom to explore the aesthetics and structure of the website. 
			</blockquote>

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>From the key statistics and information found, user profiles are made <strong>to understand the target audience</strong> that the website is going to aim at. With that, the content included and the site's aesthetic can be decided in the following stage. </p>
      <figure>
				<img  src="Images/The Actives.png" alt="The Actives" width="100%"></img><figcaption>"The Actives" Profiles</figcaption><br><br>
				<img src="Images/The Confused.png" alt="The Confused" width="100%"></img><figcaption>"The Confused" Profiles</figcaption>
			</figure>

      <h3 id="concept">Concept</h3>
      <blockquote>
				The proposed concept design is to create a website that can educate young people about renewable solar energy, encouraging them to take actions through volunteering and donation. The overall website aims to keep the content succinct and less word while having more visuals to maintain the audience’s attention to the website. The educational content includes facts about solar energy as well as news articles about the current solar energy in Australia and the world. Moreover, the website can show the NPO’s transparency by showing their campaigns and works. It will also provide information about reasons as well as ways to donate and volunteer, guiding the users to take actions hassle-free.</blockquote>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>This section <strong>explores the design and content</strong> for the website through mood boards, site maps and sketches. Multiple ideas and concepts will be explored and reiterated, including the rationale and reflections throughout the process.</p>
        <h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
        <p>Mood boards allow me to explore potential styles and colors for the website. <br><br>

        The chosen primary color is yellow as the website is about renewable solar energy and Solar Citizens’ logo is yellow. It also signifies warmth, clarity and happiness, reflecting the organization’s branding: caring, joy and trustworthy. Green is the secondary color as it is the color of nature, renewability and sustainability. <br><br>    

        The first mood board focuses on the overall aesthetic, color palettes and typography whilst the second mood board explores the website’s potential structure, elements and pages.

      <h3 id="sitemaps">Sitemaps</h3>
      <p>Before creating a website, a sitemap needs to be established in order <strong>to plan out and clarify the most appropriate content</strong> to achieve the end goals. Each iteration helps to improve the flow of the website. Through many iterations, the finalized sitemap helps to make the website concise, ensuring me to include only the essentials and avoiding any unnecessary levels and clicks. </p>

      <h4>Iteration 1</h4>
      <p>In this first iteration, the basics of the website are shown. “Solar energy” and “Get involved” sections are included as the purpose of the website to educate the users about solar energy and encourage people to get involved. The “About” section is to show the audience what the charity’s goals and works.</p>
      <figure>
          <img  src="Images/sitemap1.PNG" alt="Iteration 1" width="100%"></img><figcaption>Iteration 1</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Iteration 2</h4>
      <p>For this iteration, a contact page was added to inform the users where and how they can get in touch with Solar Citizens. Moreover, “Get involved” section is splitted into Volunteer and Donate pages to help the users navigate easier. These pages will inform the audience why and how they can donate as well as a sign up form. Moreover, it is decided that the “Solar energy” section is divided into “Educate” and “Articles” pages to avoid a large amount of information being shown in one page.</p>
      <figure>
          <img  src="Images/sitemap2.PNG" alt="Iteration 2" width="100%"></img><figcaption>Iteration 2</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Final Iteration</h4>
      <p>The final sitemap depicts the finalised structure of the website. In the first level, the “Campaign” page is made into its own section, including the NPO’s current, successful and all campaigns, allowing the audience to filter the information faster. The page is made individual as campaigning is an important part of Solar Citizens and is one of the main reason why they need donations. On the other hand, other sections remain the same from the second iteration. The second tier shows which content will be included in the website to make sure that only the most appropriate pages and elements are contained.</p>
      <figure>
          <img  src="Images/sitemap3.png" alt="Iteration 3" width="100%"></img><figcaption>Final Iteration</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
  		<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>After establishing mood boards and sitemaps, sketches are made <strong>to explore different layouts and ways to display the content</strong> for each section of my website.</p>

      <h4 id="landing">Landing Page</h4>
      <p>This page is designed with the main aim of capturing the audience’s attention and interest in the NPO, as well as providing some overview information about the charity.  Five sketches were made to explore the position of navigation bar, buttons, images and information.</p>
      <h5 id="landing1">Landing Page 1</h5>
      <p>The first sketch positions the image on the right side and isn’t contained in an actual shape or border. This creates negative space surrounding the photo, giving the page an organic flow. The navigation bar and other information are put in the left hand side. There are two main buttons “Volunteer” and “Donate” underneath so those who want to help can go straight to the volunteer or donate pages. I also tried incorporating social media icons so users can share the information to their platforms. </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/landing1.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Landing Page 1</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="landing2">Landing Page 2</h5>
      <p>The second sketch shifts the navigation bar to the top right, separating it from the logo. Similar to the first sketch, it divides the page to a content and image sides. The images are displayed in a library flow style so users can click on the arrows to see more. I also added two more options for photo displaying, one being just a simple image and other being a gallery grid style.  </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/landing2.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Landing Page 2</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="landing3">Landing Page 3</h5>
      <p>The navigation bar in this sketch is changed to a vertical direction so users can access different sections by scrolling. Meanwhile, the top left corner is used to display social media icons.  However, the separation between content and image remains the same. The shift gives the page more white space, making it look more spacious. </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/landing3.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Landing Page 3</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="landing4">Landing Page 4</h5>
      <p>The following sketch positions the navigation bar in the center while leaving the top left corner to the highlighted “Donate” and “Volunteer” sections, drawing the audience’s attention. Unlike the other sketches that separate the content and image, this one positions the less opaque images behind the texts. The audience can see other photos and information when clicking the arrows.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/landing4.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Landing Page 4</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="landing5">Landing Page 5</h5>
      <p>Unlike the previous ones, this idea positions the logo in the center of the navigation bar, separating the “About”, “Solar Energy”, and “Campaigns” with “Donate”, “Volunteer” and “Contact”. Taking upon the previous sketch with the position of image, this sketch lays over the navigation bar, creating a more natural flow to the page. The changes give the overall layout a symmetrical look as the texts and logo are both centered. Furthermore, the bottom part of the site includes four things users can do to help: educate, share, volunteer, and donate, encouraging them to take actions.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/landing5.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Landing Page 5</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4 id="about">About Page</h4>
      <p>This page aims to provide information about Solar Citizens to the users. This includes the site’s purpose and NPO’s mission, vision and values. </p>
      <h5 id="about1">About Page 1</h5>
      <p>The idea is to show the general information about Solar Citizens and what they do in a banner-like design. Following that is a short description of the NPO’s mission, vision and values accompanied with small icons and are centered from the banner The use of icons instead of images is to make the page less clustered as there is more space in between the elements.  </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/about1.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>About Page 1</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="about2">About Page 2</h5>
      <p>The second sketch takes upon a more centralised route as the description is centered inside the background image. As the image accounts the full top half, the size difference between the description and below icons show the hierarchy of information.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/about2.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>About Page 2</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="about3">About Page 3</h5>
      <p>The 3rd sketch shows the images emerge from two sides of the screen, making the page look more symmetrical and balanced.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/about3.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>About Page 3</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4 id="about">Solar Energy Page</h4>
      <p>This page includes educational materials and news articles to provide users more knowledge and insights about solar energy use. Since there will be many information are put into one page, it was challenging for me to find the most optimal way to help the users navigate the site easily</p>

      <h5 id="about1">Solar Energy Page 1</h5>
      <p>The first sketch explores the scrollable idea where users choose either “Educate” or “News” in the first page and the site will jump to the according section. However, scrolling would lose users’ interest as they wouldn’t know when the section will end, causing frustration. Instead, the chosen section should take the user to a different page rather than an ongoing single page.<br><br>
      Moreover, I also explored the way to display information in each segment. The “Educate” part is inspired by flashcards so users can grab small chunks of information faster and easier, preventing the website from being overcrowded with words. The main information about solar energy is displayed in the largest size, to direct the audience’s attention to the core knowledge. Underneath, the users can scroll through to see the NPO’s reports, enabling them to understand more about their works. The “News” section mimics a news website with the top article being the biggest, showing the hierarchy of information. It also has a filter column so users can choose the location and date that the articles are from. 
      </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/solar1.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Solar Energy Page 1</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="solar2">Solar Energy Page 2</h5>
      <p>The second idea allows the user to choose between two tabs, and helps to minimize the number of clicks or scrolls that users have to do. Moreover, the “Educate” section is separated into “Facts” and “Reports” sections to help users find the information easier. The flashcard idea in “Educate” and news filter in “News” remain the same. </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/solar2.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Solar Energy Page 2</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="solar3">Solar Energy Page 3</h5>
      <p>The last sketch experiments with the position of the tabs as well as the main title of the page. Note that there are no lines separating the small segments like in the second sketch. This is to give the website more white space, provides visual breathing for the eyes, improving the legibility and readability of the website</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/solar3.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Solar Energy Page 3</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4 id="campaign">Campaign Page</h4>
      <p>This section is used to display and inform Solar Citizens’ current and past works of campaigning to protect the use of solar energy in Australia. Similar to Solar Energy Page, there is a large amount of information that needs to be shown. Therefore, it is important to consider how it will be sorted. All the sketches will include three tabs “Current”, “Success” and “All” to make the navigation more intuitive. </p>
      <h5 id="campaign1">Campaign Page 1</h5>
      <p>The first sketch allows the users to browse the campaigns by clicking the arrows. It only shows the main photo and title of the campaign so when the users click on the image, the general description of the campaign appears. I realized that it is not very efficient to display this way as the photos take too much space, where I am to make it more condensed and succinct. Moreover, the clicking can cause frustrations as users wouldn’t know when it ends.
      </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/campaign1.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Campaign Page 1</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="campaign2">Campaign Page 2</h5>
      <p>Taking upon the weakness in the first sketch, this one shows that the photos are smaller, allowing the users to browse through the page by scrolling. The search and filter bar enables the audience to find and access to the information wanted easily.</p>

      <h5 id="campaign3">Campaign Page 3</h5>
      <p>Similar to Solar Energy Page 3, I played around with the position of the tabs. Furthermore, though this sketch already includes  sort and filter tabs, I think it needs a search bar to help the audience find the information even faster.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Campaign Page 3</figcaption>

      <h4 id="volun">Volunteer Page</h4>
      <p>This page is intended to inform the users why they need and how they can volunteer at Solar Citizens, enhancing the clarity of the NPO. Following that is a sign up form for them to receive information about upcoming volunteering activities. Moreover, I want the page to include social media icons so users can simply sign up via selected platforms and receive information through those, encouraging them to utilize social media to spread the words about Solar Citizens to their own audience. </p>
      <h5 id="volun1">Volunteer Page 1</h5>
      <p>The first idea utilizes the flashcard concept to show the crucial information. Then the user can scroll down and fill in the form. I find that although this provides a clean layout, it takes up too much unnecessary space and requires more scrolls needed. </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/volun1.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Volunteer Page 1</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="volun2">Volunteer Page 2</h5>
      <p>The second sketch is a more condensed version of sketch 1, showing a compact design. The sign up form is shown as a card to stand out the most within the page. </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/volun2.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Volunteer Page 2</figcaption>
      </figure>


      <h4 id="don">Donate Page</h4>
      <p>Similar to Volunteer Page, Donate Page contains information like where the money will go, what it is used for and why the audience should donate. To accompany the information is a donate form where users can put the amount they want to donate, their details and payment method.</p>
      <h5 id="don1">Donate Page 1</h5>
      <p>The first idea separates the page to image and content. The donation form is splitted into 3 steps: Amount, Details and Payment with the progress bar to indicate the user’s current step.  While finding that the image might occupy too much space that can be used for donation information, I was particularly interested in the donation form. Perhaps elements in the donation form such as “One-time giving” vs. “Monthly giving” will be used in the final design.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/don1.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Donate Page 1</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="don2">Donate Page 2</h5>
      <p>This page utilizes a similar layout to Volunteer Page 2, where the page is divided into 2 segments: information and donation form. Instead of a 3-step process, the form is more condensed so save the number of clicks that users have to do.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/don2.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Donate Page 2</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="don3">Donate Page 3</h5>
      <p>The 3rd idea separates the segments with a line instead of leaving a white space. Moreover, the donation form isn’t made into a card like the previous sketch. This could help with the readability of the page as there is more room to space out the fill-in boxes.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/don3.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Donate Page 3</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="don4">Donate Page 4</h5>
      <p>The last sketch for this page explores a different arrangement of information, horizontal instead of vertical. The top half is to show crucial information while the bottom half is used for donation form which is splitted into 3 steps.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/don4.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Donate Page 4</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h4 id="contact">Contact Page</h4>
      <p>The last page is used to provide contact information of Solar Citizens as well as an inquiry/message form for those who have any questions to ask the NPO. It also includes social media icons so users can visit Solar Citizens’ pages.</p>
      <h5 id="contact1">Contact Page 1</h5>
      <p>The background image is placed full screen, giving the page more depth. The overall layout is centralised, giving it a more balanced feel.
      </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/contact1.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Contact Page 1</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="contact2">Contact Page 2</h5>
      <p>The second layout is more simple with no background image so the audience is more focused on the information. The address and contact details are placed side-by-side instead of top-down to keep the information concise and the overall look cleaner.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/contact2.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Contact Page 2</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5 id="contact3">Contact Page 3</h5>
      <p>The last idea shows the donation form as a postcard in which the majority of the left is used for any messages that the audience want to send while the right side includes the NPO’s contact details.</p>
      <figure>

			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>Following the exploration and analysis of my sketches, my design is further developed through a wireframe and mockup using Adobe XD. A wireframe is needed <strong>to show the overall structure and form </strong> the website as well as to see if there are any considerations needed to make before the final mockup. Following, mockup is done <strong>to represent the overall look of the website.</strong> </p>

       
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>After analysing, the design of the wireframe is <strong>made through the considerations of the sketches' strengths and weaknesses.</strong> The finalised form and structure is also used for mobile phones to give the users the similar feeling of the website. Mobile phone is a commonly used device for young people to gain information and perform online transactions. </p>
			
      <h4 id="landingwire">Landing Page Wireframe</h4>
      <p>The landing page is mainly from the second sketch as I like the minimalist look of it while being able to balance the visual and texts.  I took some elements of the 4th sketch such as the position of the navigation elements. The purpose of it is to separate the bar into 3 parts: logo, information and take action, helping the audience to locate easier. The Donate and Volunteer buttons are highlighted to attract the audience's attention. The visual element is displayed as a slideshow as I want the images to speak for themselves. At the bottom of the page, social media icons are added to show the users the NPO’s online platforms</p>
      
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/web-landing.png"/>
        <figcaption>Landing Page Wireframe</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4 id="aboutwire">About Page Wireframe</h4>
      <p>The About page is directly translated from the second sketch. The overall layout is centered, drawing the eyes to the information conveyed. The About Us section is separated from Our Mission part to create a hierarchy of information.</p>
      
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/web-about.png"/>
        <figcaption>About Page Wireframe</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4 id="solarwire">Solar Energy Page Wireframe</h4>
      <p>Continuing with the centralised layout theme, this page is divided into “Educate” and “News” sections. The final pages combine different elements in three sketches. With the tabs on top, the users can switch between these two segments. <br><br>
      Educate page is separated into the “Facts” and “Reports” section located on the left column of the website. By scrolling the page, the users can learn snippets of solar energy facts, allowing the users to attain information fast. 
      </p>
      
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/web-educate.png"/>
        <figcaption>Educate Page Wireframe</figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>The News page allows users to look at articles about solar energy. With the filter element, they can easily filter out the news from the chosen location and date. The articles are also placed in a hierarchical order, with the current most important news being put on the biggest thumbnail.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/web-news.png"/>
        <figcaption>News Page Wireframe</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4 id="campaignwire">Campaign Page Wireframe</h4>
      <p>This page is mainly based from the second sketch with some small changes in elements that are inspired from other sketches. Similar to solar energy page, this page is sorted into “Current”, “Success” and “All” sections and the tabs on top of the page allow the users to easily toggle between these segments. With the search bar along with sort and filter functions, the audience can find and be informed about Solar Citizens’ work. </p>
      
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/web-campaign.png"/>
        <figcaption>Campaign Page Wireframe</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h4 id="volunteerwire">Volunteer Page Wireframe</h4>
      <p>This page is purely from the second sketch as I like how the register form is shown as a card, prompting the users how to sign up for it. The social media icons are being used to encourage users to use their social media platform to share about the organisation. </p>
      
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/web-volunteer.png"/>

      <h4 id="donatewire">Donate Page Wireframe</h4>
      <p>This page is from the second sketch as I want to keep the consistency with the card idea in both Volunteer and Donate Page. I also like having all the information needed condensed in one place so the users don’t have to keep clicking “Next”. I decided to add the “One-time giving” and “Monthly giving” buttons to give the option of ongoing donations.</p>
      
      <figure>

      <h4 id="contactwire">Contact Page Wireframe</h4>
      <p>The contact page also follows the card concept for users who want to send any questions or messages to Solar Citizens. </p>
      
      <figure>
				<img src="Images/web-contact.png"/>
        <figcaption>Contact Page Wireframe</figcaption>

      <h4 id="mobilewire">Mobile Phone Wireframe</h4>
      <p>This page is designed with the main aim of capturing the audience’s attention and interest in the NPO, as well as providing some overview information about the charity.  Five sketches were made to explore the position of navigation bar, buttons, images and information.</p>
